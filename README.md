### Presentation Tier
All of the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files belongs to the presentation tier of the application. The *loginpage.jpg* file is used for the background image on the Login and Create Account pages. The other images in the repository are used as example images in the HTML files. 

### Logic Tier
The PHP files are implemented as replacements for the HTML files and provide the server side code for the application. 

### Data Tier
A MySQL database was used for the data tier of the project. The file *database.sql* contains the code used to create the tables in the database. The books that make up the databse are inserted using the code from *books.sql*. The *books* folder contains the cover images displayed for each book in the dataabase, and come from goodreads.com.
